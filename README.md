# Wiwork

TODO: Write a gem description

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'wiwork'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install wiwork

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Notes

- There is a field, account_id, in some of the API return objects. I am checking, but I believe that it refers to the actual wheniwork.com account, and is therefore pretty unuseful to us here. Consequently, I am leaving it out of objects.
